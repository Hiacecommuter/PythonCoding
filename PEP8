Name Conventions
use descriptive names
1. Never use l, o, or I single letter names as these can be mistaken for 1 and 0
2. function   lowercase words separated by _    --    my_function or function
3. variables  lowercase words separated by _ 
4. class      Start each word with a capital letter  --   Model, MyClass
5. method     lowercase words separated by _
6. constant   UPPERCASE WORDS separated by _
7. Module     lowercase words separated by _
8. package    lowercase words no separator

Code Layout
1. Surround top-level functions and classes with two blank lines
2. Surround method definitions inside classes with a single blank line
3. Use blank lines sparingly inside functions to show clear steps

Maximum Line length and Line Breaking
1. 79 characters limit
2. Python will assume line continuation if code is contained within parentheses, brackets, or braces
3. If it is impossible to use implied continuation, then you can use backslashes to break lines instead

Indentation
1. Use 4 consecutive spaces to indicate indentation
2. Prefer spaces over tabs
3. Align parameters inside parenthesis
4. Add comment for condition

Comments
1. Indent block comments to the same level as the code they describe
2. Start each line with a # followed by a single space
3. Separate paragraphs by a line containing a single #

Whitespace in Experssions and Statements
1. A single space on either side ( =, +=, -=, ==, !=, <=, >=, <, >, and, or, not,...)
2. No spaces when assign a default value to a function
3. Only add space for the lowest priority operations if there are multiple operators
