CPython does garbage collection automatically when a refcount decreases to 0

Reference Cycle
  - an object references itself
  - two objects reference each other
    del object cannot remove reference cycle

Generational garbage collection
  generation-based classification
  - it classifies objects in code into three generations
  - Each object starts out at the first generation and moves to higher generations each time it survives
    a garbage collection step
  - lower generations are collected more often
  - it can detect reference cycle

gc module
  import gc
  ...
  collected = gc.collect()
  print(collected) //nums for collected objects
  ...
  
Garbage collection threshold
    gc.get_threshold() // first, second, third generation
    gc.get_count()
    get.set_threshold(int, int, int)

Note:
    string add vs string format
