class attribute vs parameters
"""

"""
In OOP, for example Python, there are two concepts in class -- attribute and parameter.
Attributes are value for object instances. 
For example, the student ID is an attribute when we create a student instance from student class. 
While, parameters are values passed to class methods when the methods are called.
